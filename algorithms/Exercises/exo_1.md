Develop a Python script exo_1.py that empirically proves the time complexity differences between data structures.

**Requirement:**

- Generate datasets of increasing size: $N = [10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6]$.

- **Task A**: Measure the time taken to check for membership (x in collection) for a List versus a Set.

- **Task B**: Measure the time taken to delete the first element of a List versus a deque.
