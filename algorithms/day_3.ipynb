    "# Recursion and Logarithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Recursive Leap of Faith\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion occurs when a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.  \n",
    "It replaces explicit loop-based state management with the implicit state management of the **call stack**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of Recursion\n",
    "Every recursive function must contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Case**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  The stopping condition (e.g., `if n == 0: return`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Without it, recursion becomes infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive Case**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  The step where the function calls itself with modified arguments that move toward the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Cost of Elegance: Stack Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, recursion is not free.  \n",
    "Each function call adds a **stack frame** containing local variables and the return address.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Space Complexity} = O(\\text{Max Stack Depth})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Python enforces a default recursion limit (typically around **1000 frames**) to prevent runaway recursion from crashing the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: Check or modify the limit using `sys.getrecursionlimit()` and `sys.setrecursionlimit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Warning: Python does **not** support Tail Call Optimization (TCO). \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the final instruction is the recursive call, Python still creates a new stack frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The Master Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the time complexity of recursive algorithms, we apply the **Master Theorem**.  \n",
    "It applies to algorithms that divide a problem of size \\(n\\) into \\(a\\) subproblems, each of size \\(n/b\\), with an overhead of $f(n)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T(n) = aT\\left(\\frac{n}{b}\\right) + f(n)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "- $a$ : number of recursive calls  \n",
    "- $b$ : factor by which the problem size is reduced  \n",
    "- $f(n)$ : cost of dividing, combining, or other non-recursive work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns\n",
    "- **Binary Search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) \\Rightarrow O(\\log n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Merge Sort:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) \\Rightarrow O(n \\log n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. The Hazard of $O(2^n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example of explosive recursion is the naive Fibonacci function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "    if n <= 1:\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a tree of calls that doubles in size with every step ($2^n$).\n",
    "- $fib(50)$ would take roughly $2^{50}$ steps (quadrillions of operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solution: Memoization (caching results). In Python, use the @functools.lru_cache decorator to turn this $O(2^n)$ nightmare into $O(n)$ linear time."
