    "- Favor `dict` / `set` when you need fast membership tests, insertions, or lookups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `list` when order matters, or when you primarily do appends / index-based access.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Beware of operations on lists that require shifting elements (insertions/deletions in middle, membership tests) — these are O(n).  \n",

    "- For bulk operations or large data volumes, always consider algorithmic complexity: even built-in methods incur costs, and choice of data structure matters.  \n",
